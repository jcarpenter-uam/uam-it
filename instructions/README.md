# UAM-IT Talos Linux Cluster

Here lies the documentation for the kubernets specific config and some of its more important features. Of course I cannot explain everything to a T, but in the world of AI it can help explain most your questions as I will only explain anything specific to my configuration and leave out general knowlegde. Once you have access to the kubectl config you should be able to figure out what is running within the cluster and do your own research and what pods serve what purpose. There is also a nice looking section on the main `README.md` that displays some of the core installed apps.
